            <h3>Build yourself a successful web developer</h3>
            <p>I have some reasons to be a web developer. Itâ€™s a great place for a career and I love it. It enhances the
                ability to create solutions to challenging and creative problems. It provides organizational skills and
                job opportunities anywhere in the world. So I am learning and mastering web development. I will not stop
                until I become a web development hero.</p><br>

                    efficient. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called
                    Vue
                    JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a web developer. I made their website and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
